# findMakerspace

A simple way to find makerspaces in the United States.  A Python script was written to scrape Google search data for makerspaces in each state.  After some sorting and verifying of each link, a json file was created to list the name and url for each makerspace found.

A US map svg was created in order create a interactive UI for searching for spaces.

This is a work in progress and I hope to add more search options, countries, interactivity and more!
